<h1> TFT </h1>
<h2> One of the greatest strategy games in the world </h2>

<p> 
  <em> 
    <strong> 
      TFT 
    </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the most fun games to play. The game gives you a sense of autonomy as it is just you against seven others in a FFA to detirmine who comes out on top. The game is very nostalgic of classic board games, having elements of chess and more. It's a game that tests your strategical mind to the limit, as you plan out characters, or units, on your board to fight against other boards. You have to make items, manage an economy, and select 3 different special powers throughout the course of the game to be successful. It's a different experience every time!

I've been a 
  <em> 
    <strong> 
      TFT 
    </strong>
  </em>
  player since set 6.5, which is obviously not that much seeing as TFT is in set 9 right now, but it has quickly soared to one of my favorite games. One of those reasons is because it is a great game to play with friends. You can play with one other person in a mode called 
  <b>
    Double Up
  </b> or fill out a lobby with just friends and compete against eachother! Anyways, TFT is classified into Sets, which completely rehauls the fundamentals of the game (the units you can play, the 'special powers'/augments, etc.) TFT aims to bring a new experience everytime you play, keeping it fresh and fun.
